# CNN-Architectures-for-Handwritten-Image-Classification
To classify images containing handwritten digits using multiple custom-built CNN architectures, which may or may not are inspired from standard Convnet architectures such as LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet etc. A comparison between performance of different architectures are done.
